                <AccordionTrigger>What is paper trading?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent>
                  Paper trading is a simulated trading process where you can practice buying and selling stocks without using real money. 
                  It's a risk-free way to test your trading strategies and learn how the stock market works.

                <AccordionTrigger>How is my portfolio value calculated?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent>
                  Your portfolio value is the sum of your available cash and the current market value of all your stock holdings.
                  The unrealized profit or loss (P&L) is calculated by comparing the current value of your holdings with your initial investment amount.

                <AccordionContent>
                  Yes, you can reset your portfolio to the initial cash balance (â‚¹10,00,000) by going to the Settings page and clicking the "Reset Portfolio" button.
                  This will clear all your holdings and transaction history, allowing you to start fresh.

                <AccordionContent>
                  No, this is a paper trading simulation. All money is virtual, and while the stock data is based on real Indian companies, the price movements are simulated and do not reflect real-time market conditions.
